1. Microcontroller folder contains basic code for manipulating stick angles and velocity with horizontal motion
2. Image Processing contains the models which take input and act on the live video feed of the camera facing the goalkeeper
3. Simulation Map- Maps the simulations ahead based on inferences from 2
4. Reinforcement Learning-Experimentation
5. IoT Sensors-Research on kind of datapoints which can be made available
